# oisproject

This project provides (or will provide when it's done) a proxy between an Objects in Space process and a control panel of some sort.

It seems to me that there's value in preprocessing the evnt stream, to e.g. only produce events when values change, rate limit some 
values, e.g. pressure, handle 'master warning' behaviour for groups of events...
